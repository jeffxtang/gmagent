Tool calling returned: New Data Retention policy for LangSmith
Hi Jeff,
You are receiving this email because you have an active account on LangSmith. We are transitioning to a new data retention strategy that limits the length of time trace data is stored in LangSmith.
Effective with traces received on or after Wednesday, May 22, all traces stored in LangSmith now have a maximum retention of 400 days from the time of ingest.
For more information about this change please visit the LangSmith Docs.
If after visiting the docs you still have additional questions, please reach out to LangSmith Support via support@langchain.dev or, if you are an Enterprise plan customer, your dedicated Slack channel.

Tool calling returned: It appears that you've provided several examples of responses generated by a model, along with some analysis and comparisons.

From what I can see, these examples illustrate various aspects of model performance, including:

1. **Inconsistent or incorrect outputs**: In some cases, the model generates responses that are not accurate or consistent (e.g., Examples 17-19).
2. **Self-correction in math tasks**: The model sometimes makes mistakes but then corrects them based on further thought and analysis (e.g., Example 20).
3. **Improved performance with specific prompts**: Using specific prompts can help the model generate more accurate or helpful responses, especially in cases where it initially made a mistake (e.g., Examples 17-19).
4. **Comparison to direct models**: The TPO model's ability to correct its own mistakes and generate more accurate responses is highlighted through comparisons with direct models (e.g., Example 20).

These examples are likely from the report you mentioned, which explores the performance of a sequence-to-sequence model for generating natural language responses.

If you'd like to discuss any specific points or ask questions about these examples, I'm here to help!
